The API Integration project in Full Stack Web Development focuses on seamlessly connecting front-end applications with back-end services through the use of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). In this project, a front-end application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with bootstrap framework, while the back-end is developed with technologies using an "API By Ninjas" Api. The primary objective is to integrate external or internal APIs to fetch, send, and manipulate data across different systems.

Key steps include designing the user interface, setting up API calls to external services like weather data, and ensuring smooth data flow between the front and back ends. The back-end handles requests, processes data, and communicates with databases or other services, while the front end displays the data dynamically in a user-friendly manner.

Security measures such as authentication and authorization (OAuth, JWT) are incorporated to ensure that data exchanges are secure. The project also emphasizes error handling, performance optimization, and creating a responsive, interactive user experience. By integrating various APIs, this project demonstrates the power of full-stack development and API utilization in building modern, data-driven web applications.

The tools used in this project are VS Code text editor,chrome browser and rapidApi
